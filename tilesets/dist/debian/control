Description: modernized version of the classic roguelike
 NetHack Fourk is a modernized version of the classic game NetHack,
 based on the NetHack4 codebase, which, compared to 3.4.3, adds a
 completely new user interface, numerous bugfixes, and much more.
 On top of that, NetHack Fourk makes various balance adjustments
 and attempts to relieve tedium.
 .
 NetHack itself is perhaps the best-known "roguelike" game: a screen-oriented
 dungeon crawler in which levels are randomly generated, giving a different
 gameplay experience each time. NetHack's emphasis is on developing your
 character in the way you want; if it feels like something should be possible,
 it probably is. The eventual goal of the game is to collect the Amulet of
 Yendor from deep in the dungeon, but concentrating on learning to survive in
 the dungeon should be most players' first priority; winning the game can take
 months of learning, as when a character dies, you have to restart the game from
 scratch.
 .
 This package contains the files required both to play in a terminal, and to
 play in a separate window with optional graphical tile support.
